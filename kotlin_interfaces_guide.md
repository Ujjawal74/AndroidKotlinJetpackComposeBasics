# Kotlin Interfaces: A Beginner-Friendly Guide

---

## 1. What is an Interface?
An **interface** in Kotlin is like a **contract**. It tells what a class *can do*, but not *how* it does it.

- It defines **methods (functions)** and **properties** that a class must provide.
- Classes that use an interface must follow its rules.

👉 Think of an interface as a **blueprint**.

Example:
```kotlin
interface Animal {
    fun makeSound()
}
```
This says: *"Any class that is an Animal must know how to make a sound."*

---

## 2. Why Do We Need Interfaces?
You might ask: *"Why not just use normal functions?"* Good question! Functions are useful, but interfaces solve special problems.

### Benefits of Interfaces:
1. **Consistency (Contracts)**  
   If a class claims to be an `Animal`, it *must* implement `makeSound()`.

2. **Polymorphism**  
   You can write one function that works on many types.
   ```kotlin
   fun playSound(animal: Animal) {
       animal.makeSound()
   }
   ```
   Works for `Dog`, `Cat`, or any future `Animal`!

3. **Multiple Behaviors**  
   Kotlin classes can only extend **one class**, but they can implement **many interfaces**. This means you can mix abilities.
   ```kotlin
   interface Camera { fun takePhoto() }
   interface GPS { fun getLocation(): String }
   
   class Smartphone : Camera, GPS {
       override fun takePhoto() = println("Photo clicked!")
       override fun getLocation() = "Latitude: 40, Longitude: -74"
   }
   ```

4. **Scalability**  
   Adding new types doesn’t break old code. Interfaces make your code flexible and easy to extend.

## 3. Is It Like a Class?
- **Similarities**:
  - Both can have functions and properties.
- **Differences**:
  - A class can hold **state** (variables, constructors).
  - An interface cannot hold state, only rules/behaviors.
  - A class can extend **only one** class, but can implement **many** interfaces.

👉 **Class = what it is**  
👉 **Interface = what it can do**

## 4. Examples

### Example 1: Simple Interface
```kotlin
interface Animal {
    fun makeSound()
}

class Dog : Animal {
    override fun makeSound() = println("Woof!")
}

class Cat : Animal {
    override fun makeSound() = println("Meow!")
}

fun main() {
    val dog: Animal = Dog()
    val cat: Animal = Cat()

    dog.makeSound()  // Woof!
    cat.makeSound()  // Meow!
}
```
✅ `Dog` and `Cat` must follow the `Animal` contract.

---

### Example 2: Default Implementation
```kotlin
interface Vehicle {
    fun start()
    fun stop() {
        println("Vehicle stopped!")
    }
}

class Car : Vehicle {
    override fun start() = println("Car starting...")
}

fun main() {
    val car = Car()
    car.start()   // Car starting...
    car.stop()    // Vehicle stopped!
}
```
✅ Interfaces can provide **default functions**.

---

### Example 3: Multiple Interfaces
```kotlin
interface Camera { fun takePhoto() }
interface GPS { fun getLocation(): String }

class Smartphone : Camera, GPS {
    override fun takePhoto() = println("Taking a photo...")
    override fun getLocation() = "Lat: 40, Long: -74"
}

fun main() {
    val phone = Smartphone()
    phone.takePhoto()
    println(phone.getLocation())
}
```
✅ One class can implement many interfaces.

---

## 5. Interfaces vs Normal Functions
### Without Interface:
```kotlin
fun driveCar() = println("Driving a car...")
fun flyPlane() = println("Flying a plane...")

fun startJourney(vehicleType: String) {
    when(vehicleType) {
        "car" -> driveCar()
        "plane" -> flyPlane()
    }
}
```
❌ Problem: Adding new vehicles means editing `startJourney()` everywhere.

### With Interface:
```kotlin
interface Vehicle { fun move() }

class Car : Vehicle {
    override fun move() = println("Driving a car...")
}

class Plane : Vehicle {
    override fun move() = println("Flying a plane...")
}

fun startJourney(vehicle: Vehicle) {
    vehicle.move()
}
```
✅ Future-proof: Adding `Bicycle` doesn’t break old code.

---

## 6. Interfaces vs Abstract Classes
Both are used for abstraction, but:
- **Abstract Class** = *"What it is (base class)"*
- **Interface** = *"What it can do (ability/behavior)"*

👉 Example:  
- `Bird` (abstract class) → has wings, lays eggs.  
- `Flyable` (interface) → can fly.  
- `Sparrow` → `Bird` + `Flyable`.  
- `Penguin` → `Bird` but **not** `Flyable`.

---

## 7. Quick Summary
- **Interface = contract/ability.**
- Classes can implement multiple interfaces.
- They provide **polymorphism**, **consistency**, and **flexibility**.
- Use interface when you want to define *what something can do*, not *what it is*.

---

✅ With this understanding, you can now easily identify when to use classes, abstract classes, and interfaces in Kotlin!
